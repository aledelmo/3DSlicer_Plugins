# 3DSlicer_Plugins
In this repository it is possible to find a collection of the in-house developed IMAG2 plug-ins for 3D Slicer.
There are currently four of them:

1. Bladder.
2. Bones.
3. DiffusionPelvis.
4. TractographyPelvis.<br/>

In 1. and 2. two segmentation algorithms are presented, respectively for the bladder and the hips. 3. and 4. are collections of 
tools for the processing of diffusion images and tractography methods.

Each plug-in has it's own README.MD where you can find additional information on the installation, implementation
and usage.

These four plug-ins compose the basic IMAG2 software suite. They can be complemented by:
* PQL: the first method for the segmentation of pelvic tractograms.
* Tractography Metrics: tool for the analysis of fiber bundles.
* VesselSegmentation: deep-learning based approach for the automatic recognition of veins and arteries.
* IMAG2 Utilities: collection of various scripts.
